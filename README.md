# Payroll Tracker
A javascript application to practice concepts such as arrays, while loops and random number generation.

## Description
In this exercise we were given some starter code (noted by comments in the js file) and we needed to create the functions that would prompt the user to add employee data to an array, take the average of one element of the employee data, and select and display a random employee.
